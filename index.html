  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an informat
    ion system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uni
    form Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may
    be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
    The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protoc
    ol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a we
    b browser, and are published by a software application called a web serv
    er. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-ex
    isted the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technolog
    ies the Web is built.
